# Switch Operated Rotating Phone Stand 

## Overview
<!--- A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs. --->
In this project, we were able to create a 360-degree camera stand. 

It makes it easier for photographers to make it easier for steady shots, either photo or video. 

The operating gear shifter is about $6.00.

## How to Obtain the Device
### Do-it-Yourself (DIY) or Do-it-Together (DIT)

This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build the device are contained within this repository. Refer to the Build Instructions below.

## Build Instructions
<!--- Outline the major steps required to create a build --->

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Servo_Phone_Stand_Bill_of_Materials.pdf](/Documentation/Servo_Phone_Stand_Bill_of_Materials.pdf) lists all of the parts and components required to build the device.

### 2. Print the 3D Printable Components

All of the files and individual print files can be found in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

Reference the [Servo_Phone_Mount_3D_Printing_Guide.pdf](/Documentation/Servo_Phone_Mount_3D_Printing_Guide.pdf) for the tools and steps required to print the base.

### 3. Assemble the Phone Stand

Reference the [Rotating_Phone_Stand_Assembly_Guide.pdf](/Documentation/Rotating_Phone_Stand_Assembly_Guide.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build the device.

## How to improve this Device
As open source assistive technology, you are welcomed and encouraged to improve upon the design.
