# Switch Operated Rotating Phone Stand 

## Overview
<!--- A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs. --->
In this project, we were able to create a 360-degree camera stand. 

It makes it easier for photographers to make it easier for steady shots, either photo or video. 

The operating gear shifter is about $6.00.

## How to Obtain the Device
### Do-it-Yourself (DIY) or Do-it-Together (DIT)

This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build the device are contained within this repository. Refer to the Build Instructions below.

## Build Instructions
<!--- Outline the major steps required to create a build --->

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components  
The [Servo_Phone_Stand_Bill_of_Materials.pdf](/Documentation/Servo_Phone_Stand_Bill_of_Materials.pdf) lists all of the parts and components required to build the device.

### 2. Print the 3D Printable Components  
All files are located in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.  
Use the [Servo_Phone_Mount_3D_Printing_Guide.pdf](/Documentation/Servo_Phone_Mount_3D_Printing_Guide.pdf) to guide your prints.

### 3. Assemble the Phone Stand  
Follow the [Rotating_Phone_Stand_Assembly_Guide.pdf](/Documentation/Rotating_Phone_Stand_Assembly_Guide.pdf) for step-by-step build instructions.

### 4. Read Through the User Guide  
The [Rotating_Phone_Stand_User_Guide.pdf](/Documentation/Rotating_Phone_Stand_User_Guide.pdf) contains detailed usage tips, safety information, and final setup/testing procedures to ensure the device functions as intended.

## How to Improve this Device
As open source assistive technology, you are welcomed and encouraged to improve upon the design.
